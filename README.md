# Reflection:
This project was quite the challenge. I can't wait to learn responsive design so I can make a website that's designed for both desktop and mobile! The site isn't completely broken at different resolutions, but it wasn't designed with responsiveness in mind. Aside from that, I am quite pleased with how the design turned out and the functionality of it all. The javascript bit for password confirmation is short and sweet. There were definitely some frustrating times followed by breakthroughs. Overall, I enjoyed this project and am really looking forward to the next.
